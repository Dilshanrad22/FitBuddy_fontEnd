# FitBuddy (React Native - Expo)

This repository contains a minimal Expo-based React Native scaffold for the FitBuddy mobile app.

## Quick start (PowerShell)

1. Install dependencies:

```powershell
cd "c:\New folder (3)\EAD\FitBuddy_fontEnd"
npm install
```

2. Start the Expo dev server:

```powershell
npx expo start
```

3. Run on a device or emulator using the Expo dev tools (scan QR or press a/i/android shortcuts).

Notes:
- This scaffold uses Expo (managed workflow). If you want a bare React Native project (native Android/iOS projects), tell me and I can convert it.
- You may want to install the Expo Go app on your phone for quick testing.
